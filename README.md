# gdoc-review

`gdoc-review` is a simple script utility that utilizes `asciidoctor` and `pandoc` to generate a Google Doc from a local AsciiDoc file for easy review.

## New in this version

* Removed dependency on the `gdrive` tool which cannot be used without setting up GCP IAM access to your GDrive account ðŸ˜§

## Prerequisites

* Install [Asciidoctor](https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoctor/latest/install/linux-packaging/). On Fedora, run `sudo dnf install -y asciidoctor`.

* Install [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/installing.html). On Fedora or RHEL, run `sudo dnf install pandoc`.

* Install the `gio` CLI tool for working with [Gvfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GVfs) resources. The script uses `gio` to work with files in mounted Google Drive folders. On Fedora or RHEL, run `sudo dnf install glib2-devel`.

* Add `~/bin` to your system path. For example, add the following line to your `~/.bashrc`: 

```bash
export PATH=$PATH:~/bin
```

* Connect your Red Hat Google account to your online account in the Settings app in Fedora or RHEL and select `Files`. This mounts your Google Drive folder locally.

## Installing

* Copy the `gdoc-review` script to `~/bin`, and run `chmod a+x ~/bin/gdoc-review` to allow the script to be executed from anywhere.

* Create a `~/.gdoc-review` file populated with frequently used Asciidoctor variables. This ensures that variables are always resolved in the output. For example:

```ini
[asciidoctor-attributes]
product-title=OpenShift Container Platform
product-version=4.14
sno=single-node OpenShift
sno-caps=Single-node OpenShift
cgu-operator-first=Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager (TALM)
cgu-operator-full=Topology Aware Lifecycle Manager
cgu-operator=TALM
redfish-operator=Bare Metal Event Relay
rh-rhacm-first=Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (RHACM)
rh-rhacm=RHACM
ztp=GitOps ZTP
ztp-first=GitOps zero touch provisioning (ZTP) 
op-system-first=Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS (RHCOS)
op-system=RHCOS
icons=image
iconsdir=/home/aireilly/icons
```

That's it! The script should now be ready to use.

## Getting started

Open a shell prompt and run `gdoc-review <asciidoc_file>`. You can run the script for modules or assemblies. For example:

```
$ gdoc-review modules/ztp-cluster-provisioning.adoc
```  

Follow the link to open the generated Google Doc. Open the output file in Google Docs to begin the review. 

**Note:** Every run of `gdoc-review` overwrites the previous output.
